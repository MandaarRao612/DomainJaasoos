# Domain Jasoos

**Domain Jasoos** (डोमेन जासूस) is an enhanced version of the popular `httprobe` tool, designed to detect the status codes of active subdomains and generate a structured JSON report. This fork not only probes for active domains but also categorizes them based on their HTTP status codes and records any redirects.

## Features

- **Probes HTTP and HTTPS endpoints**: Checks both `http` and `https` versions of each subdomain.
- **Status Code Detection**: Retrieves and records the HTTP status codes returned by each domain.
- **Redirection Tracking**: Identifies and records the URLs of any redirects encountered during probing.
- **JSON Output**: Automatically generates a JSON file categorizing subdomains by their status codes, including details of any redirections.

## Example Output

Here’s a sample of the JSON output generated by Domain Jasoos:

```json
{
    "200": [
        "https://onthego.tatamotors.com",
        "https://acetest.tatamotors.com"
    ],
    "301": [
        {
            "url": "http://www.buses.tatamotors.com",
            "redirected_url": "https://buses.tatamotors.com"
        }
    ],
    "302": [
        {
            "url": "http://eworkshop.tatamotors.com",
            "redirected_url": "https://eworkshop-redirect.tatamotors.com"
        }
    ],
    "403": [
        "https://middleeast.countrysites.tatamotors.com"
    ]
}
